# Prime-Numbers-Count
The purpose of this program is to calculate the number of prime numbers between a given lower value and upper value  inputed by the user.

The purpose of this program is to understand the use of this keyword as well as working with methods 
and user input to calculate the number of prime numbers within a given set: lowest and highest value number a user enters.

Area for improvement: 
Initially, I struggled to understand how I could calculate the number of prime numbers within a given range. 
Using an ArrayList method seemed to be the most viable option. 

What I liked: 
I enjoyed calculating the number of prime numbers within a given range: lowest and highest number value. 
I will be sure to revisit this program in the future.
